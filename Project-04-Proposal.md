<h2> Project 4 Proposal </h2>


<p>
I've been trying to find some evidence that you can have a little video play in the background of a twine page, but I never found anything. I was thinking maybe instead I would just make a little story on the beach with a lot of sounds to try and make it immersive, but I'm really bad a getting a good story going. I kind of wanted to make it like the Anna Anthropy game where the world always ends, but in this case it would be corona that ends the game and puts you in quarantine. This is the direction I've been going so far with this project. I don't know why I waited so long to do the proposal.
