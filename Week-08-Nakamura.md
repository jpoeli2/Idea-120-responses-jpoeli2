<h2> Week 8 Response </h2>
<!--
discuss in about 2 paragraphs how you believe Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich saying "interactive media ask us to identify
with someone elseâ€™s mental structure" is to be understood. Discuss one example in depth of how aspects of tools you may use 
(such as Gmail, Instagram, TikTok, etc) are reflections of the designer's or developer's 'mental structure' and their own identity.

I think Nakamura's citation of Lev Manovich is to be understood in a similar light as celebrities and how they have an affect on people and trends. They have an affect on people 
and can sway their opinions and make people want to be like them without them really even knowing why. Nakamura is saying that interactive media is like a projection of the 
developer's mental structure and since we are forced to use their interface and recieve information from algorithms that the developer made we are being asked to think in the same
manner as the people who make that form of media. 
I've never really thought about this before, so it was pretty eye opening makes a lot of sense to me because whenever I open Instagram and go to the discover tab I almost never
find anything of interest and don't spend much time on it. Even though it's called a discover tab, I can't really seem to discover that uch that is similar to what I follow, so
it feels like I'm being forced to find these accounts. Another way social media is a projection of someone else's mental structure is Youtube because 
something I was thinking about was how Youtube can just recommend you videos based on what you watch, but also sneak in videos about politics or just videos they support while 
hiding the ones they don't like from you. I noticed how now there's a few videos about the news and politics in my recommended even though I don't watch news at all, so Youtube
can just recommend me to watch a news topic from a certain channel, and maybe that channel has a viewpoint that aligns with Youtube or a developer. Basically, someone has the 
ability to feed you information from a source that they approve of asking that you think in a similar way and have similar opinions. This is sort of related to the previous
topic of having our activities monitered and having ads or videos geared towards what we have searched or watched, and if we would think more for ourselves if we had more standardized
stream of information.
