<h2> Green Screen Project Proposal </h2>
<!--
 -->

<p>
For this project I was thinking of using a 3d software, but I don't know if that's allowed. I wanted to create my normal working space, but make alter and change dramatically, but I only know how to do that in a 3d software that I use. If I can't use it then I was thinking of making my background the inside of a car that's driving around the world.

 Jared's reply:
Yes! Please use 3D modeling/animation software if you feel comfortable doing so and would be able to animate it in some way or composite it (edit it together) with another video in motion. Remember that it needs to be a 1 minute video loop, but that being said, the motion can be very very subtle as well. It sounds like if it's a normal working space that we might not realize at first that it's altered? Does it transform over time to be dramatically different? Does it start sort of photo-realistically and then morph into something more fantastical? Is there a performative element between you in the foreground on Zoom and the working space in the background? Have a look at our workshop from Tuesday on Photoshop (https://vimeo.com/469623026/c0871dccff) and how you can use it when editing videos in Premiere to create images you can layer on top of videos playing in the background - it might be useful here. Let me know if you have questions!
