<!-- In this response provide an example of a kind of image that would be read differently if it were seen in another medium (for example, posts by Instagram 'influencers', food photography, or click-bait news articles). What are the 'three messages' (as laid out by Barthes) this kind of image contains? -->

<img src="https://media-assets-01.thedrum.com/cache/images/thedrum-prod/s3-serena_williams_ig_feed_85682--default--1280.jpg" alt="Nike Ad" width="550" height="700">

<p>
The example I'm giving is a Nike ad with a picture of Serena Williams and a caption "If they think your dreams are crazy, show them what crazy dreams can do." If this was seen in a different medium like Instagram people would just scroll right past it and not give it much thought because there's ads like this all the time. On the other hand if it was seen in a stadium, like on the big screen, then people would probably view it as inspiring or get them excited for whatever game they're watching.

<p>
The three messages that Barthes explains are Linguistic, Coded, and Non-Coded messages. In this ad, the linguistic message is the caption saying "If they think your dreams are crazy, show them what crazy dreams can do." It gives the reader the sense that just because a dream you may have seems crazy or impossible to people, it doesn't mean it's unattainable and encourages them to achieve their dreams and prove people wrong. The coded message is that Serena Willams, a very good tennis player, is mid serve and about to hit a tennis ball wearing nike apparel further representing them. The non-coded message would be that a women is playing tennis. The combination of these three elements leads the reader to think that maybe Serena Williams is the person who said the caption or quote and makes the reader think that she's giving inspiring advice or that she's successful because of this mentality.

<p>Response: I think it's interesting that we both chose advertisements for our image and that the advertisements we chose are very different. The one I used was very straightforward in its message, while this one is more subtle and nuanced. I definitely agree with the idea that an ad like this would be mostly ignored if seen on social media. Why do you think this ad would have more of an impact if viewed in person at a stadium rather than if it was just seen online? What is it about that experience that makes the ad more appealing to people? Also, do you think the effectiveness of this image would change depending on how knowledgeable a person is about sports, or would it stay relatively similar?</p>
